## Game state autoload scene.
## 
## Game_Manager is an autoload scene that carries data between scenes. This is used because Godot likes to drop everything between scenes.
## [br]
## Since many of us come from Unreal, think of this as a GameMode.
## [br]
## [br]
## This tracks the currently selected characters, the currently active character, whether each character has been used during a fight, the health values of each character, the round number of the current boss fight, and a dictionary of all playable characters in the game and whether they are currently unlocked or not.
## [br]
## [br]
## The Game_Manager interacts with the "players" group, which gives an array of characters in the scene.
## [br]
## [br]
## Certain methods should be called from other scripts. E.g. update_active_character should be called whenever you swap character. The appropriate time to call each method will be included in its description.

## A list of characters that are selected for the current run.
var selected_characters: Array[Node]
## This is a variable used to store the index of the currently active character.
var active_character_index: int = 0
## An array of booleans that flag whether each selected character has been used in the current round.
var has_been_used: Array[bool] = [false, false, false]
## An array of health values for the three selected characters.
var character_health_values: Array[int]
## An int counter used to track the current round of the current run.
var round_number: int = 0

var queued_stages: Array[String] = []

## A dictionary of all characters in the game, paired with boolean values for whether they are unlocked or not.

## Updates currently active character. It is called whenever you swap character.
##[br]
##[br]
## This method takes in an integer, which represents the index of the newly-active character.
##[br]
##[br]
## update_active_character(1)
##[br]
## This would update the active character to index 1, which is the second character in the list.
## [br]
## [br]
## It also flags that the character has been used in this fight using the has_been_used array.
func update_active_character(index: int):
	active_character_index = index
	has_been_used[index] = true

## This method swaps the character from the current character to another character in the selected_character list.
##[br]
##[br]
## It takes in an index, which is supplied by player inputs. Pressing 1 will pass in index 0 (swap to character 1), pressing 2 will pass in index 1 (swap to character 2), etc.
##[br]
##[br]
## The method gets the level node. It then assings the current player in the level to a temp_player placeholder variable. E.g., if you are swapping FROM King Arthur to another character, temp_player becomes King Arthur.
##[br]
## The level player then becomes the newly-selected character. If you are swapping to Robin Hood, for example, then level.player now stores Robin Hood.
##[br]
## It then adds the newly-selected character to the scene, sets it's position to that of the temp_player, and then removes temp_player from the scene.
##[br]
## This leaves you with just one character in the scene - the one that you swapped to.
##[br]
## The active character index variable is then changed accordingly to match the currently-played character.

## Respawn character takes the position of the player, removes them from the tree, and then adds them back onto the tower after a few seconds.
