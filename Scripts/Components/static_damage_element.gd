extends StaticBody2D
class_name StaticDamageElement

## A solid element that deals damage.
##
## StaticDamageElement is a solid object trap that deals damage to the received collision body. It cannot be moved through. For an area of effect damage trap that the player and enemies can pass through, look for DamageElement.

## This has a knockback effect on received collision bodies, bouncing them away after dealing damage.

## The amount of damage dealt by the trap.
@export var damage_amount: int = 2
## The force with which the trap bounces away the received collision body.
@export var bounce_force: float = 200
## Damage type to apply.
@export var damage_type: DamageType.Type = DamageType.Type.PHYSICAL
## A boolean that says whether the trap will despawn after a specified amount of time.
@export var despawn_boolean = false
## A float that specifies the time until the trap should despawn.
@export var despawn_time = 0
## An empty variable to store the recieved collision body's health component.

## Array of currently colliding bodies / node2Ds.

## Adds newly collided bodies to the colliding_objects Array for later processing.

## Processes all the colliding bodies in colliding_objects.
