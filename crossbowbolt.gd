extends BaseProjectile

class_name CrossbowBoltAttack

## A CrossbowBoltAttack that inherits from BaseProjectile.
##
## CrossbowBoltAttack is a projectile that can explode on impact, leaving behind lingering flames. The Crossbow bolt deals damage on impact, and the flames use the DamageElement class to deal damage over time.

## A variable used to store the health component of the received collision body.
var health_component
## A preload of the damage element scene, so that we can instance it to represent flames.
var flames_scene = preload("res://Scenes/Components/damage_element.tscn")
## A variable that stores the root node of the level on ready, so that flames can be spawned as a child of the level.
@onready var level_root = get_tree().current_scene

func _ready():
	pass

## A collision method that triggers when a body collides with the Crossbowbolt. This deals damage to the received collision body if it has a health component, and then makes the Crossbowbolt explode if it is set to explode in the editor.
##[br]
##[br]
## We have to check if the collision body has a health component because the Crossbowbolt can also collide with a wall, at which point it should not try to remove health.
func _on_crossbow_area_body_entered(body):
	if body.has_node("HealthComponent"):
		health_component = body.get_node("HealthComponent")
		health_component.remove_health(damage_value, damage_type)
		delete_projectile()
		print("I HIT SOMETHING")
	if impact_explosion:
		explode()
	else:
		delete_projectile()

## A method that instances a damage element to represent flames, sets its scale appropriately, and then deletes the projectile.

## The flames currently linger forever. However, once another branch is merged into main, we can implement simple functionality that allows us to set them to despawn after a certain amount of time in code.
